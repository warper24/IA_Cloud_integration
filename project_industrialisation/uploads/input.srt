1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 Mr. President, we asked our viewers if they had questions.
2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,960
 Here are a couple.
3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,840
 Jamie T. from Virginia said, one of your biggest messages in campaign slogans was,
4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
 Drain the swamp.
5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,480
 But the idea that serving the American people is a privilege and not a career, and that
6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,680
 politicians are supposed to answer to the American people and not the opposite.
7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,520
 When will your administration be putting together a proposal for term limits for Congress?
8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,510
 Well, we're looking into that right now.
9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,710
 Right now I want to get those congressmen to go and approve Obamacare and all the different
10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,710
 things that we're working on.
11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,710
 One step at a time.
12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,710
 We'll be doing it, really.
13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,350
 I mean, that's something down the road a little bit.
14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,350
 A lot of people don't like that, frankly.
15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,190
 You know, they consider term limits to be an election, but I think it would be a good
16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,190
 thing.
17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,490
 But right now what I want to do is get Obamacare approved and I want people to love us.
18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,970
 Approved or changed?
19
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,250
 Well really, well changed when I say Obamacare.
20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,630
 I mean I'm talking about real change.
21
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,550
 And I suspect the first thing that's going to change will be the name.
22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,810
 But we're talking about repealing and replacing.
23
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,930
 And if we don't do that, I would be very upset.
24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,220
 Nobody's going to get thrown out of their insurance, are they?
25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,300
 Because that's what a lot of people are saying on the left.
26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,360
 They're saying millions of people
27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
 are gonna lose the insurance.
28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,040
 No, they have it all wrong.
29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,960
 And you're gonna hear about it during the speech,
30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,820
 but they have it all wrong.
31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,520
 We're gonna have a really great healthcare plan,
32
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,280
 and it's gonna be much more affordable.
33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
 Right, and gentle.
34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,160
 Including for the country.
35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,240
 Go ahead.
36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,920
 I know when you were inaugurated,
37
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,650
 you put your hand on your Bible that
38
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,130
 your mother had given you as a child.
39
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,290
 I know as a mother, as parents, we pray for our children.
40
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,290
 We want the best for them.
41
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,170
 And your parents, they probably prayed for you so much, but maybe not, they might not
42
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,730
 have realized that you were going to get this far.
43
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,810
 And I know they would be very proud of you.
44
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,970
 That leads me to this question.
45
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,890
 Ronald wrote us and said, I pray for you daily.
46
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,850
 Do you take time to pray?
47
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,490
 I do actually.
48
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,490
 And to me it's very important.
49
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,490
 But that's so nice.
50
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,490
 Who is that?
51
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,490
 That's Ronald.
52
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,490
 Well, hello Ronald.
53
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,490
 We ought to bring Ronald to the White House.
54
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,490
 He'd be happy to come.
55
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,490
 I like Ronald.
56
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,970
 And this is the last one.
57
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,000
 Alan Sherman from Queens says, I'm a diehard New York Mets fan.
58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Since you're a native of the great borough of Queens but moved to Manhattan,
59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 are you a Mets fan or a Yankees fan?
60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 The fate of the world relies on this answer.
61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Well, I don't think it does, but actually, I do like both teams.
62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I love the Steinbrenner family and the Wilpon family and Randy Levine and the whole group.
63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,130
 Randy has done a terrific job. He's involved with the Yankees.
64
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,530
 Now you're probably going to win New York.
65
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,330
 Well, I don't know, but I do like both teams. I really do.
66
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,330
 What about Social Security people? My age are worried that it might run out by the time
67
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,330
 we need it.
68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,330
 You're going to be okay.
69
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,830
 That was Ainsley from Manhattan.
